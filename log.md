## Day 1: October 12, 2022, Wednesday

### Today's Progress:

[#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/):

- Updated [log.md](https://github.com/byeJohn/-100DaysOfCode/new/main)

[mooc.fi](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/):

- Completed Part 01_01 - Part 01_05

### Thoughts

- Today I attended a Google Talk session at my University, which gave me the drive and motivation to improve myself academically. This led me to 
  try the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge again.
- I began the mooc.fi Java Programming 1 Course, hoping to solidify my Java programming skills. Through mooc.fi, I read about the fundamentals of 
  strings, how to properly request for user input, how to properly print out text, the boilerplate of Java programs, etc.
- So far I have been able to go through this course with ease due to previously talking an Introduction to Java course in Spring 2021. This course 
  has provided me with more in-depth explanations of how programming works.
